# Sinatra-Investor Property Tracker

Investor Property Tracker is a Sinatra web application that keeps track of all investment properties that an investor would own. Create a new user or login and enjoy building your portfolio of buildings. 

You get to use basic CRUD functionality by 'creating', seeing the property or 'reading', 'updating' and 'deleting' rental properties or users. Some basic styling that's pleasing to the eye is sure to get you hooked! Thanks for checking out Sinatra Investor Property Tracker!
