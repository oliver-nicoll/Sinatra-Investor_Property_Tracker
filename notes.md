## Questions for Laura

rethink the relationship for income belongs to or has many through?

data table for income: I want to make essentially a join table the connects both income and rentals to the investor.
    I want the income controller to be able to grab all of the rental.monthly_rent and add it up from rentals.all to then multiply it by 12 to then render Yearly_income from all rentals - investors need to be able to see what they are projected to make.

need help with seeding info - depends on how income table will be layed out

rental new.erb wont work because of method in show?
